## üé® Configuration & Customization

Making this page your own is easy! All customizations are done in the `src/lib/` and `public/` directories.

### 1. Changing Text, GIFs, and Phrases

All text content and image paths are stored in one central file:

‚û°Ô∏è **File to edit:** `src/lib/translations.ts`

Inside this file, you'll find an object with keys for each language (`en`, `vi`, `zh`). You can edit the following fields for each language:

- `question`: The main question being asked.
- `yesButton`: The text on the "Yes" button.
- `noButton`: The initial text on the "No" button.
- `yesConfirmation`: The celebratory message after "Yes" is clicked.
- `noPhrases`: An array of strings that appear on the "No" button as the user interacts with it.
- `images`: An array of image/GIF paths to be displayed.
- `yesImage`: The final image/GIF shown after success.

**Important:**

- Place your new images/GIFs inside the `public/images/` directory.
- The number of items in the `noPhrases` array **must match** the number of items in the `images` array for the animations to sync up correctly.

### 2. Changing the Background Music

1.  Place your MP3 file in the `public/audio/` directory.
2.  Open the main page component: `src/app/[lang]/valentine-client-page.tsx`.
3.  Find this line (around line 32):
    ```javascript
    const audio = new Audio("/audio/doro.mp3");
    ```
4.  Change `/audio/doro.mp3` to the path of your new music file.
